Rustlings is a learning resource people use to learn rust, usually alongside the Rust book, as rustlings is mainly the excercises for people to try and complete as it helps solidify their knoelwdge they learned from the rust book.
The reason I put my exercises in a repository is to save the progress I make towards rustlings on my laptop and my pc.
